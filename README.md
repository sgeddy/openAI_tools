# openAI_tools
Repo to store the different scripts and utilities I build as I test and learn about the OpenAI API.

INITIAL UPDATE JAN 24TH, 2024 == primary tool is the codeChecker file. This CLI utility prompts the user to input the file name to check for bugs in the code, then uses chatGPT to output improvements and the corrected code.
